        Website Evaluation:
        <br />
        <a href="http://nicolecahoon.com" target="_blank">Nicole Cahoon, CPA</a>
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've decided to analyze the website of Nicole Cahoon, a local
        accountant. During my exploration of her website, I was able to
        determine 3 major aspects which could use improvement.
      </p>
    </header>

    <main>
      <section>
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few layout issues with the site which make it feel
          unprofessional. This is <small>(likely)</small> antithetical to the
          way Nicole wants to portray her brand.
        </p>

        <h3>Headers</h3>
        <p>
          This is my main issue. For every page on the website, the same header
          image is used. This header image does not accurately reflect the
          content of the various pages its used on. Even worse, using the same
          image over and over comes across as lazy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the header image used is set to display far too large.
          On my monitor, which is a standard size of 1920x1080p, the header
          images take up the entire window and the header text itself doesn't
          show up until you scroll halfway down the page. On mobile, these
          headers render more reasonably, indicating that perhaps the website
          was designed with a mobile-first ideology.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          I think using the dog picture on the home page is fine, but for the
          other pages the designer should consider using more relevant content.
          When talking about how you help local businesses, why not use a
          picture of a local client's storefront? (With permission, of course.)

        <h3>Miscellaneous/Smaller Issues</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Awkward whitespace <em>everywhere</em>, like in the footer, or on
            the
            <a href="http://nicolecahoon.com/contact/" target="_blank"
              >Contact</a

            and
            <a

            pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Facebook button in the nav bar feels unnecessary and out of
            place, being an off-site link that looks exactly like and is in the
            same place as the on-site navigation buttons.

            seem to be caused by empty paragraphs.

        <h2>Colour</h2>
        <p>
          The 3 main colours used, pure black, pure white, and (almost) pure
          yellow, are piercing and hard on the eyes. There are insufficient
          contrast ratios in many places, namely the testimonials page and home
          page, where combinations of grey and black are used.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is easily fixable, and largely up to personal taste. If I were
          redesigning this page, I might use an
          <span
            class="mouseover-text"
            title="A bit like I'm doing right now, actually."
            >off-white background and off-black text</span
          >, which would be easier on the eyes. Yellow can still work as an
          accent colour, but I would definitely tone it down.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/palette.png"
            alt="A palette of off-white, off-black, and gold"
          />
          <figcaption>
            An example of the current palette, compared to a palette I might
            use. The new colours have been picked from Google's

        <h2>Text/Formatting</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few formatting fixes that could be made to make the
          content cleaner and improve operability.
        </p>

        <h3>Special Characters</h3>
        <p>
          The most egregious issue when it comes to the website's text
          formatting is the rendering of special HTML characters on the
          <a
            href="http://nicolecahoon.com/bc-financial-resources/"
            target="_blank"
            >BC Financial Resources</a
          >
          page. These symbols were visible on both desktop browsers and on
          mobile.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/specialcharacters.png"
            alt="A list of links with special HTML characters unintentionally visible"
          />
          <figcaption>
            A screenshot of the special HTML characters in question. These are
            line separators, and should not be visible to the client. This issue
            can be caused by lazily pasting text from another program without
            checking it first.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>
          Links are used throughout the site, but it's hardly obvious. This is
          because they all lack underlines, which have become an accepted,
          universal indicator that a piece of text is a clickable link.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/links.png"
            alt="Headers on the home page, which include anchor elements rendered without underlines"
          />
          <figcaption>
            These are headers from the home page. They're actually links to
            their respective pages, but how is someone supposed to be able to
            tell without hovering their mouse over one? What about mobile users,
            who can't hover at all?
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Miscellaneous/Smaller Issues</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Email and phone number links in the footer and on the
            <a href="http://nicolecahoon.com/contact/" target="_blank"
              >Contact Us</a
            >
            page could be made clickable.
          </li>
          <li>

            >
            page, Conlan White is listed and has a photograph but nothing
            written about him. It makes his inclusion seem like an afterthought.
