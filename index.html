        <p>
          I've decided to analyze the website of Nicole Cahoon, a local
          accountant. During my exploration of her website, I was able to
          determine 3 major aspects which could use improvement.
        </p>
      </header>

      <!--
      A NOTE:
      I originally had written this section on how the website was lacking HTTPS.
      Upon consideration, I realize this is not within the scope of the assignment.
      I have commented it out, as I didn't want to waste the writing I'd done.

      <section>
        <h2>HTTPS</h2>
        <p>
          The first issue — and arguably the most important — was one I noticed
          before I had even started loading the page: Nicole's website is not
          using HTTPS. This results in a warning before even accessing the page
          in almost any modern browser, on any device. This, obviously,
          negatively impacts one of the main purposes of having a website,
          marketing yourself and your brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, this issue is easily fixable. Many web hosts can issue,
          install, and renew
          <abbr title="Secure sockets layer/Transport layer security">
            SSL/TLS
          </abbr>
          certificates for you. If your web host doesn't, there are ways to get
          your own certificates from a
          <abbr title="Certificate authority">CA</abbr>. One example is
          <a href="https://letsencrypt.org" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>, a
          CA that provides certificates for free in the interest of creating a
          safer internet.

        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few layout issues with the site which make it feel
          unprofessional. This is <small>(likely)</small> antithetical to the
          way Nicole wants to portray her brand.
        </p>

        <h3>Headers</h3>
        <p>
          For every page on the website, the same header image is used. This
          header image does not accurately reflect the content of the various
          pages its used on. Even worse, using the same image over and over
          comes across as lazy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the dog picture on the home page is fine, but for the other
          pages the designer consider using more relevant pictures. When talking
          about how you can help local businesses, why not use a picture of a
          client's storefront, or a wide shot of downtown Courtenay?
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the header image used is set to display far too large.
          On my monitor, which is a standard size of 1920x1080p, the header
          images take up the entire viewport and the header text itself doesn't
          show up until you scroll halfway down the page. On mobile, these
          headers render more reasonably, indicating that perhaps the website
          was designed with a mobile-first ideology.

        <h3>Miscellaneous/Smaller Issues</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Awkward whitespace <em>everywhere</em>, like in the footer, or on
            the Contact and BC Financial Resources pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Facebook button in the nav bar feels unnecessary and out of
            place, being an off-site link that looks exactly like and is in the
            same place as the on-site navigation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <figure>
          <div class="image-row">
            <div class="image-column">
              <img
                src="images/whitespace1.png"
                alt="An empty paragraph on the BC Financial Resources page" />
            </div>
            <div class="image-column">
              <img
                src="images/whitespace2.png"
                alt="An empty paragraph in the footer section" />
            </div>
          </div>

      <section>
        <h2>Colour</h2>
        <p>
          The 3 main colours used, pure black, pure white, and pure yellow, are
          piercing and hard on the eyes. There are insufficient contrast ratios
          in many places, namely the testimonials page and home page, where
          combinations of grey and black are used.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is easily fixable, and largely up to personal taste. If I were
          redesigning this page, I might use an off-white background and
          off-black text, which would be easier on the eyes. Yellow can still
          work as an accent colour, but I would definitely tone it down.
        </p>

            An example of a palette I might use. Colours picked from Google's
            Material Design libary. It is, incidentally, also similar to the
            palette I'm using on this website. I am a creature of habit.
